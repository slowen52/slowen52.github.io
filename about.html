    <p id=testimony> Romeo and Juliet are two dogs that were found as strays when they were only small pups. They were adopted and now live in the wide fields of Kansas. Their newfound owner says "I'm so happy to have found PuppyLove because now I have found my love for puppies again! These dogs are super sweet. I hope that more people come to PuppyLove and give these dogs a new home." </p>  </center>
